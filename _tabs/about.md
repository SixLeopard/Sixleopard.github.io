Hi, I’m Jamie

I’m a recent computer science graduate and aspiring developer with a strong interest in software engineering, machine learning, data engineering, and building practical technology that solves real problems.

I studed Computer Science at The University of Queensland, where I majored in Machine Learning. This blog is a space where I share what I’m learning as I go—whether that’s experimenting with deep learning models, building backend systems, automating anything, or reflecting on lessons from real-world projects. My goal is to break down complex ideas, document solutions that actually work, and create resources I wish I had earlier in my journey.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, refining old projects, and staying curious about how software can make everyday work smarter and more efficient.

Thanks for stopping by.
